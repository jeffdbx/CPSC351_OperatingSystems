These assignments were from my CPSC351 Operating Systems class about 3 years ago.
My first introduction to multi processes and threads (will upload that code soon).
The code isn't pretty as it's a ghastly mix of C and C++, with no classes. 

If I ever have time, I may go back and update/clean them up. For now, I leave them
here for the sake of completion.
