These assignments were from my CPSC351 Operating Systems class about 3 years ago.
This was my first introduction to multi processes and threads.
The code is a little rough mix of C and C++, without classes. It is unchanged from when it was written (with the exception of cleaning up formatting).  
It gives me a reference to see how my code progresses.
